# Hello! I'm Alexander Pendleton
I make software, mostly for the web, and I'm available for contract work. 

Web sites and programming caught my interest in grade school, and I've been working professionally since 2004. I love building software that makes peoples' lives better and easier.

## What I Can Do
JavaScript and C# are my bread-and-butter, on the server-side. I'm quite comfortable on the client-side too! 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have been my life-blood, through many frameworks and paradigm shifts. I have experience with many technologies, wearing many hats. Learning quickly is one of my treasured skills.

- Web APIs in front of your database? You got it. 
- React web sites? No problem. 
- Polyglot microservices in Node, Golang, and .Net Core? Been there, done that.
- Legacy ASP.Net apps that need some love? My pleasure.

Anything else? I'm a problem solver, there's a good chance I can help. Let's chat!
